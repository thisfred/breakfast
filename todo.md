## To do list


* cache scope graphs (or partial paths?)
* add other refactorings
  * extract function/method
  * inline function/method
* add go to definition
* refactor State into the graph where possible
* migrate to tox or nox, so we can test against all supported python
  versions locally as well as in github actions.
* refactor lines/guaranteed lines (use fields?)
